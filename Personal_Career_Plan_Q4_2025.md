**Created:** October 25, 2025
**Last Updated:** November 18, 2025

---

## Current Situation (October 2025)

### Employment Status
- **Outright (Fractional Tech Director):** 20 hrs/week, $74k annually (was $148k full-time)
- **Side Contracting:** Additional hours for income to reach full-time equivalent
- **Financial need:** Must reach full-time income by end of December 2025 (2 months away)

### Trust & Satisfaction Level with Outright
- **Trust level:** Low - "don't trust them to do right by me"
- **Satisfaction:** "Never felt 'at home' at Outright"
- **Job security:** Moderate timeline pressure - concerned about potential replacement by early 2026
- **Compensation history:** No raise in 1.5 years; would need $160k to consider staying long-term
- **Strategic approach:** Outright plan is primarily about buying time while pursuing other opportunities

### Active Job Applications
1. **Maryland Staff Engineer Frontend** (FAMLI program)
   - Salary: $119k-$147k (growth to $185k)
   - Remote eligible (Eastern time zone)
   - Mission-driven state work
   - Have connections/referrals
   - Status: Waiting to hear back

2. **Teal Media - Senior Full-Stack Developer**
   - Salary: $115k-$145k
   - Fully remote
   - Mission-driven (nonprofit/social impact focus)
   - Have connections/referrals
   - Status: Waiting to hear back

### Core Skills & Strengths
- **Frontend excellence:** HTML/CSS/JS (20 years experience)
- **WordPress expertise:** Custom themes, standard WordPress builds (nonprofit sweet spot)
- **Client-facing skills:** Excellent communication, ideating on sales calls, managing expectations
- **Sales/scoping:** "Promise high, scale to reality" - good at winning work and delivering strategically
- **Nonprofit sector expertise:** 20 years consulting exclusively for nonprofits
- **Broad technical knowledge:** Full-stack generalist

### What's NOT Working
- **Previous team mismatch:** Junior devs focused on Next.js/headless WordPress (wrong fit for client needs)
- **Income gap:** Making half previous salary with no clear path back at Outright
- **Cultural fit:** Outright's "cool, hip designers" vibe doesn't align with need for process/structure
- **Job security uncertainty:** Fractional role feels precarious

---

## Personal Goals & Priorities

### Primary Goal: Secure Full-Time Income by End of December 2025

**Timeline: 2 months**

**Options (in priority order):**

1. **Land new full-time position** (Maryland or Teal Media)
   - Preferred outcome
   - Better cultural fit likely
   - Mission-driven work aligns with 20 years nonprofit experience
   - Remote flexibility

2. **Grow side contracting to full-time equivalent**
   - Backup if job search takes longer
   - Provides income bridge
   - Maintains flexibility
   - More control, less organizational politics

3. **Negotiate back to full-time at Outright** (least preferred)
   - Only if $160k salary offered (demonstrates commitment)
   - Would still likely be temporary while continuing job search
   - Trust issues run deep

### Secondary Goal: Position for Long-Term Career Satisfaction

**What would make a role ideal:**
- Mission-driven work (nonprofit sector, social impact, government services)
- Remote or hybrid flexibility
- Fair compensation ($145k-$160k range)
- Organization that values process AND creativity (balance, not extremes)
- Stability and trust in leadership
- Opportunity to leverage 20 years nonprofit tech experience
- Room for both technical work and strategic/client-facing work

## Three-Track Strategy: November 2025 - December 2025

**UPDATE (November 18, 2025):** Added Track 3 - Worker Cooperative exploration as long-term option. See `Track_3_Worker_Cooperative_Framework.md` for full details.

### Track 1: Active Job Search (Primary Focus)

#### Week 1-2 (Late October - Early November)
- [ ] Follow up on Maryland and Teal Media applications
- [ ] Research and identify 3-5 additional opportunities in nonprofit tech sector
- [ ] Update LinkedIn profile to highlight nonprofit expertise and frontend/WordPress skills
- [ ] Reach out to former colleagues who made referrals for status updates
- [ ] Prepare portfolio/case studies (Ocean Conservancy project, others)

#### Week 3-4 (Mid November)
- [ ] Apply to 2-3 additional positions if Maryland/Teal haven't progressed
- [ ] Network within nonprofit tech community (reconnect with 5 former clients/colleagues)
- [ ] Consider NTEN membership for job board access and visibility
- [ ] Prepare for interviews (practice talking about transition from full-time to fractional)

#### Week 5-8 (Late November - December)
- [ ] Interview preparation and execution for any active opportunities
- [ ] Decision point: If offers received, evaluate against criteria
- [ ] If no movement, accelerate Track 2 (side contracting expansion)

**Key job search criteria:**
- Remote or Eastern time zone
- $115k+ minimum salary
- Mission-driven organizations (nonprofits, government, social impact)
- Frontend/full-stack WordPress or modern frontend stack
- Stable organizations (not agencies in transition)

### Track 2: Income Bridge via Side Contracting (Parallel Activity)

#### Immediate Actions (November)
- [ ] Audit current side contracting commitments and capacity
- [ ] Calculate: How many additional hours/clients needed to reach $148k equivalent?
- [ ] Reach out to 3-5 existing agency/client relationships for additional project work
- [ ] Set up simple project pipeline tracking (can use free Trello or similar)
- [ ] Define ideal contract engagement (hourly rate, project types, hours per week)

#### Expansion Strategy (November-December)
- [ ] Leverage nonprofit network for freelance opportunities
- [ ] Position services: "WordPress expert for mission-driven organizations"
- [ ] Offer: Custom WordPress themes, accessibility improvements, performance optimization
- [ ] Target rate: $125-150/hr (justify with 20 years experience)
- [ ] Goal: 20-30 billable hours/week from contracting = $7,500-13,500/month additional

**Potential client sources:**
- Former nonprofit clients from 20-year career
- Agencies needing WordPress contractor support (like current arrangements)
- Nonprofits found through NTEN network
- Small agencies in DC/Baltimore area needing overflow support

### Track 3: Worker Cooperative Exploration (Long-Term Play)

**NEW TRACK (November 18, 2025)** - See `Track_3_Worker_Cooperative_Framework.md` for comprehensive framework.

**Vision:** Build democratic, worker-owned cooperative providing web development services to nonprofits.

**Timeline:** 12-36 months to viability (NOT a solution for December 2025 deadline)

**Why explore this:**
- Democratic ownership ("no more don't trust them to do right by me")
- Leverages 20 years nonprofit network
- Values alignment with mission-driven clients
- Specific people identified (PM, dev, designers)
- Part-time compatible while doing Tracks 1-2
- Proven model (Palante, CoLab, Agaric all succeed)

#### Immediate Actions (November-December 2025)
**Commitment: 8-12 hours/month (minimal time while focusing on Tracks 1-2)**

- [ ] Reach out to PM contact: Gauge interest in worker co-op conversation
- [ ] Reach out to Drupal/WordPress developer: Same
- [ ] Reach out to 1-2 designers: Same
- [ ] Schedule first exploratory meeting (2 hours)
- [ ] If interest exists: Register for USFWC free startup webinar
- [ ] Download "Think Outside the Boss" from SELC (free manual)
- [ ] First 3 meetings: Study co-op model together, assess commitment

#### Next 3-6 Months (January-June 2026)
**Only if core group remains engaged**

- [ ] Weekly 2-hour meetings (study co-op model, market research)
- [ ] Interview 15-20 potential nonprofit clients (market validation)
- [ ] Decide: Proceed to incorporation or not?
- [ ] If yes: Engage cooperative-friendly lawyer (Virginia co-op corp recommended)
- [ ] Each member contributes $500-$1,000 initial buy-in

**Integration with other tracks:**
- **If Track 1 succeeds (got job):** Co-op becomes part-time passion project
- **If Track 2 succeeds (freelancing):** Co-op formalizes that structure
- **If both stall:** Co-op accelerates as primary path forward

**Key point:** Track 3 is parallel exploration, compatible with Tracks 1-2, provides long-term option regardless of short-term outcome.

## Track 4: Outright Management Strategy (Minimal Effort, Maximum Optics)

**Purpose:** Stay employed and valued through early 2026 evaluation while executing Tracks 1-2

### November 2025: Quick Wins
- [ ] Present Digital Practice Growth Plan to Jared/Tracy (early December)
- [ ] Join Sarah's Outlign evaluation (demonstrate collaboration)
- [ ] Complete CRM evaluation and recommendation
- [ ] Book NTC 2026 conference (shows commitment to growth)
- [ ] Publish 1 LinkedIn thought leadership article

### December 2025: Show Progress
- [ ] Pilot Outlign with one contractor project
- [ ] Begin CRM setup
- [ ] Publish second thought leadership article
- [ ] Document any wins from sales pursuits or client work

### January 2026: Maintain Momentum (if still there)
- [ ] Complete CRM migration
- [ ] Expand Outlign to all contractor projects
- [ ] Publish third article
- [ ] Prepare Q1 report showing 90-day wins

**Effort level:** Minimum necessary to maintain position and demonstrate value. Most energy goes to Tracks 1-2.

**Exit scenarios:**
1. **Got new job:** Give 2 weeks notice, offer to help with transition
2. **Built contracting to full-time:** Negotiate reduced hours at Outright or exit gracefully
3. **Outright offers $160k full-time:** Seriously consider, but likely still pursue other options given trust issues
4. **Outright wants to eliminate role:** Have other options already in motion

---

## Financial Reality Check

### Current Income (Half-Time at Outright)
- Base: $74k annually from Outright
- Side contracting: Variable (need to calculate actual current earnings)
- **Gap to previous full-time:** $74k

### Target Income (Full-Time Equivalent)
- Minimum acceptable: $145k (matches top of Teal Media range)
- Ideal target: $160k (previous salary + adjustment for 1.5 years)
- Stretch goal: $175k (accounts for experience growth)

### Monthly Budget Needs (Calculate Actual)
- [ ] Document actual monthly expenses
- [ ] Determine true minimum income need
- [ ] Calculate runway if there's savings buffer

### Decision Framework
**By December 31, 2025, I need:**
- Option A: New full-time job offer accepted
- Option B: Contracting income at $12k+/month consistently
- Option C: Outright full-time offer at $160k (unlikely and not preferred)

**If none of above:** Emergency plan needed (not defined yet)

---

## 12-Month Vision (Through Q4 2026)

### Ideal Scenario (Best Case)
**March 2026:**
- Working full-time at Maryland FAMLI or Teal Media (or similar)
- Earning $145k-160k
- Fully remote or hybrid
- Engaged in mission-driven work
- Building relationships with new team
- Perhaps maintaining 5-10 hrs/week side contracting for income boost and variety

**September 2026:**
- Established in new role, proven value
- Contributing to meaningful projects
- Work-life balance sustainable
- Income stable and sufficient
- Side contracting optional, not necessary

**December 2026:**
- Performance review demonstrates strong impact
- Potential for raise/promotion in 2027
- Professional satisfaction high
- Financial stress resolved
- Clear growth path ahead

### Realistic Scenario (Likely)
**March 2026:**
- Either: Started new position (lower end of salary range, proving myself)
- Or: Building freelance practice (15-25 hrs/week contracted work, $8k-12k/month)
- Still working part-time with Outright OR cleanly exited

**September 2026:**
- New job: Settling in, looking for promotion opportunities
- Freelance: Established client base, considering whether to pursue full-time or seek employment
- Income: $120k-145k range

**December 2026:**
- Stable income
- Less stress than current situation
- Options for 2027 (either grow in current role or pivot)

### Contingency Scenario (If Job Search Stalls)
**March 2026:**
- Built freelance to 30+ hrs/week
- 3-5 regular clients
- Outright reduced to 10 hrs/week or exited
- Income: $10k-15k/month
- Evaluating: Continue freelance vs. keep job searching

**Decision point:** Is freelance sustainable and satisfying, or do I want organizational employment?

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Neither job application comes through
**Mitigation:**
- Apply to 5+ additional positions by mid-November
- Expand search beyond nonprofit sector if needed (agencies, consultancies)
- Consider contract-to-hire positions
- Leverage 20 years of network more aggressively

### Risk 2: Can't scale side contracting fast enough
**Mitigation:**
- Start outreach NOW (early November) to build pipeline
- Consider joining freelance platforms (Upwork, Toptal) as backup
- Offer retainer packages to existing contacts (predictable income)
- Reduce expenses if possible to extend runway

### Risk 3: Outright eliminates role before other options materialize
**Mitigation:**
- Present growth plan by early December (buys 2-3 months)
- Document wins clearly (CRM choice, Outlign pilot, conferences booked)
- Maintain excellent client work quality
- If eliminated, negotiate severance and transition timeline

### Risk 4: Accept wrong job out of financial desperation
**Mitigation:**
- Define minimum acceptable criteria NOW (before desperation sets in)
- Build income bridge through contracting to avoid desperation timeline
- Remember: Another bad fit is worse than a few months of hustle
- Trust 20 years of experience - the right fit will value that

### December 20, 2025: Final Q4 Checkpoint
**Questions to answer:**
- Job offers received or imminent?
- Contracting income at target level?
- January plan: What's the primary focus?

**Adjust January strategy based on where things stand**

### Monthly Check-ins (Ongoing)

## Non-Negotiables

**I will NOT:**
1. Stay at Outright below $160k unless absolutely desperate
2. Accept a role that doesn't align with mission-driven values
3. Work for another "cool, hip" agency that resists process
4. Settle for less than $115k salary in new position
5. Sacrifice remote flexibility without significant compensation
6. Rush into wrong fit out of financial pressure (if at all possible)

**I WILL:**
1. Prioritize roles in nonprofit tech sector (20 years experience is valuable)
2. Maintain quality work at Outright while there (professionalism matters)
3. Be honest with myself about whether freelance vs. employment is better
4. Leverage network more actively than in past job searches
5. Document wins and build portfolio as I go
6. Make income decisions based on data, not fear

## Reflection & Mindset

**What I know to be true:**

**What I need to remember:**
- Desperation leads to bad decisions
