# Job Board Scripts

Automated scripts for managing your Job Board (JB) Jira project.

## Setup

### First Time Setup

1. **Add columns to your board** (2-3 minutes):
   ```bash
   cat SETUP-GUIDE.md
   ```
   Follow the guide to add the 7 columns via Jira UI.

2. **Verify setup**:
   ```bash
   ./verify-jb-setup.sh
   ```

## Daily Scripts

### Create New Application

./create-job-application.sh
```
Interactively create a new job application. Prompts for:
- Company name

- Priority (1-3)

### View Pipeline
```bash
./list-job-pipeline.sh
```
Shows all applications grouped by status with counts and priorities.

### Update Application Status
```bash
./update-job-status.sh
```
Move an application through the pipeline (e.g., Applied â†’ Screening).

### Weekly Review
```bash
./weekly-review.sh
```
Comprehensive weekly summary with:
- New applications this week
- Pipeline status breakdown
- Hot opportunities (interviews/offers)

## Recommended Workflow

### Daily (2-3 minutes)
```bash
./list-job-pipeline.sh
```
Quick check of your pipeline status.

### When Adding Opportunities
```bash
./create-job-application.sh
```
Add new opportunities as you find them.

### When Status Changes
```bash
./update-job-status.sh
```
Move applications through the pipeline when you:
- Submit an application (Backlog â†’ Applied)
- Get a screening call (Applied â†’ Screening)
- Start interviews (Screening â†’ Interviewing)
- Receive an offer (Interviewing â†’ Offer)
- Accept/reject an offer (Offer â†’ Accepted/Closed)

### Weekly (10 minutes)
```bash
./weekly-review.sh
```
Run every Monday to:
- Review progress
- Identify stale applications
- Plan the week ahead

## Tips

### Set Up Aliases
Add to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
alias job-new='~/sites-personal/tims-career-plan/scripts/create-job-application.sh'
alias job-list='~/sites-personal/tims-career-plan/scripts/list-job-pipeline.sh'
alias job-update='~/sites-personal/tims-career-plan/scripts/update-job-status.sh'
alias job-review='~/sites-personal/tims-career-plan/scripts/weekly-review.sh'
```

Then simply use:
- `job-new` to create applications
- `job-list` to view pipeline
- `job-update` to move cards
- `job-review` for weekly summary

### Weekly Cron Job
Set up a weekly reminder:

```bash
# Add to crontab (crontab -e)
# Run every Monday at 9am
0 9 * * 1 cd ~/sites-personal/tims-career-plan && ./scripts/weekly-review.sh
```

### Labels
When creating applications, use priority:
- `1` = Tier 1 (dream companies) ðŸ”¥
- `2` = Tier 2 (solid opportunities)
- `3` = Tier 3 (backup options)

Add custom labels in Jira for:
- `remote`, `hybrid`, `onsite`
- `startup`, `enterprise`
- `referral`, `direct-apply`, `recruiter`

## Troubleshooting

### "No such file or directory" for .env.local
The scripts source credentials from `~/sites-personal/libarycard/.env.local`.
Make sure this file exists and contains `JIRA_API_TOKEN`.

### "Permission denied"
Make scripts executable:
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

### "Issue not found"
Make sure you're using the correct issue key format: `JB-1`, `JB-2`, etc.

### API Token Expired
Generate a new Atlassian API token:
1. Go to: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Create new token
3. Update `JIRA_API_TOKEN` in `.env.local`

## Next Steps

After setup:

2. Move them through the pipeline as you progress
3. Run weekly reviews to stay on track
4. Analyze metrics to improve your approach

Good luck with your job search! ðŸš€
