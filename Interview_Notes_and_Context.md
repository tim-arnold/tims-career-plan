# Interview Notes & Context - October 25, 2025

Raw notes and answers from initial planning conversation to preserve full context for future sessions.

---

## Initial Request

Tim wanted help creating a one-year plan for growing the tech team at Outright back to where he is engaged full-time with an additional developer. Context: Was full-time Tech Director ($148k), managed two junior developers, cut to half-time (20 hrs/week, $74k) four months ago when the junior devs were let go.

**Initial framing:** Grow the digital practice at Outright
**Real goal (revealed later):** Stay employed while finding better opportunities

---

## Key Interview Answers

### Business & Client Context

**Q: Current client portfolio - what types of projects?**
- Outright is truly a "creative agency" - excels at brand and design work
- Tim's role: Help win work that includes websites so they don't lose integrated brand+web pursuits
- Best success: Non-profit sector
- Recent big win: Ocean Conservancy redesign (~$200k for brand, design, and website build) - probably largest web build to date
- Sweet spot: Mid-sized WordPress org sites (Ocean Conservancy was on large side)
- Other clients: YouTube, Schmidt Foundation, Fayetteville (tourism) - mainly brand/marketing work, not web
- Portfolio: https://weareoutright.com/our-work

**Q: Pipeline & capacity?**
- "We have plenty of capacity" - engaged with several contractors
- One contractor agency with "basically unlimited capacity" (offshore devs they scale up as needed)
- Currently 2 exclusive web projects + 1 add-on to other work (the ideal type) in active pipeline
- Constraint is NOT delivery capacity - it's **deal flow**

**Q: Client sectors?**
- Non-profit (strongest for web work)
- Arts & Entertainment
- Tourism
- Corporate clients (Marriott, YouTube) - no opportunity to expand digital with them, they handle internally

**Tim's current utilization (20 hrs/week):**
- Sales pursuits
- Supporting internal tech needs
- Evaluating systems
- Smaller one-person web projects (landing pages)
- Ongoing support, enhancements
- Support/troubleshooting/bug fixing client sites
- Ongoing client work (even when junior devs were there, Tim handled this)

### Sales & Business Development

**Who leads sales?**
- Jared (CEO)
- Tracy (Managing Director)
- Anne (Director, Marketing) - primary owner of sales pipeline
- Tim leads when opportunity is web-focused, pulls together people for proposals
- Different people lead depending on factors

**Current pipeline management:**
- Anne is primary owner
- Managed mainly by Jared, Tracy, Anne
- No CRM yet - Tim is evaluating HubSpot, Copper, and Pipedrive
- Don't have good insight into why they win/lose opportunities
- Need better process to track what they win/lose, why, and to whom

### Internal Team & Dynamics

**Agency size & structure:**
- Annual revenue: ~$1.2M
- Key decision-makers: Jared (CEO) and Tracy (Managing Director)
- Director of UX (not named)
- Anne (Director, Marketing)
- Sarah (Director, Operations) - handles contractor relationships
- Grace (respected internal resource, VERY process-oriented, potential ally)

**Important relationships:**
- Grace: Very respected, VERY process oriented, excellent potential compatriot for process improvements
- Sarah: Operations Director, closely aligned with Grace, will help with process argument
- Sarah is evaluating Outlign (https://outlign.co/) for staffing and resource planning
- Timeline for Outlign: Done around end of year, Q1 2026 (same as CRM)

**Contractor situation since June:**
- Working well financially
- Contractors work on fixed fees - Outright never loses money on dev portion
- **Frustration:** Contractors frustrated by "just winging it" approach
- PMs and designers ask for features/changes all via Slack (ad-hoc)
- Contractors want ticketing system (Jira, Trello, etc.)
- **Internal resistance:** "We're cool, hip designers and process is just a bummer, man"
- Jared doesn't want too much process - fears it reduces quick agile thinking
- Jared and Tim worked together at previous larger agency that had too much process
- Jared blames that partly on the "dryness" of the work generated

### Previous Team Situation

**Why weren't junior devs a good fit?**
- Focused solely on Next.js and headless WordPress
- NOT a great solution for small-to-medium organizational info sites that clients need to manage themselves
- Tim didn't have expertise in Next.js/headless to mentor them
- Builds "easily went off the rails"
- For Outright's web projects, "fairly standard custom themes in vanilla WordPress way are much better"

**What happened to ongoing work when they left?**
- Still internal
- Tim handles technical aspects
- A project manager contractor handles PM parts

### Tim's Skills & Role

**Technical strengths:**
- Excellent HTML/CSS/JS frontend person
- WordPress custom themes (vanilla/standard approach)
- NOT strong in Next.js/headless (that was the junior devs' focus)
- Broad general skills
- 20 years consulting exclusively for non-profits

**Unique value to Outright:**
- Very broad skills
- Seen as valuable in sales pursuits
- Excellent at client communications
- Excellent at ideating on sales calls with prospects
- "I promise high and am able to then scale things to what we can pull off and what they can afford"
- Client-facing skills
- Sales/scoping expertise
- Integration with brand team
- Quality control

**Team vision (if full-time + additional developer):**
- Another WordPress developer with general skills
- Fairly senior skill level
- Can handle heavier custom backend work (complement Tim's frontend strength)
- NOT another Next.js/headless person

## The Real Situation (Revealed Progressively)

### Financial Reality

**Current compensation:**
- Was: $148,000 full-time
- Now: $74,000 half-time (20 hrs/week)
- **No salary increase in 1.5 years**
- Side contracting: Mainly for financial reasons (partly out of interest)
- **Critical need: Must be full-time by end of year (December 31, 2025)**
- Only ~2 months away from this deadline

**What would it take to stay at Outright?**
- Would need to be raised to nearly $160k
- That would demonstrate enough commitment from them
- Equity is a possibility but Tim doesn't care about it

### Trust & Satisfaction

**Direct quote:** "I don't really trust them to do right by me"

**Direct quote:** "I've never felt 'at home' at Outright"

**Concern:** "I am concerned that if I don't deliver a compelling vision to them in the next few months (by early 2026) they may get rid of me and bring in someone else, or just work directly with the contractors and eliminate my intermediate position"

**Trust issue depth:** "fairly deep"

**Ideal scenario:** "Going back full time is possible, but not my first choice"

### Active Job Search

**Current applications (as of Oct 25, 2025):**

1. **Maryland - Staff Engineer Frontend**
   - URL: https://www.jobapscloud.com/MD/sup/bulpreview.asp?b=&R1=25&R2=005484&R3=0014
   - FAMLI (Family and Medical Leave Insurance) program
   - $118,937–$146,666 salary (growth to $185,523)
   - Remote eligible (Eastern time zone)
   - 6 years engineering experience required
   - 3 years JavaScript, 3 years accessible frontend
   - Deadline: September 22, 2025 (NOTE: This seems like an error - may be 2026?)
   - Status: Has connections, former colleagues reached out to recommend him
   - Waiting to hear back

2. **Teal Media - Senior Full-Stack Developer**
   - URL: https://tealmedia.com/career/senior-full-stack-developer/
   - Remote position
   - $115,000–$145,000
   - Mission-driven organizations (nonprofit/social impact)
   - Two senior-level positions available
   - Status: Has connections, former colleagues reached out to recommend him
   - Waiting to hear back

**Outright knows he's "looking around" for better or worse**

**If he found another opportunity:** "I'd definitely leave Outright if the opp was right"

### Strategic Approach

**What the Outright proposal really is:**
- "This Outright proposal is buying me time while looking for other things"
- NOT genuinely meant to make Outright attractive enough to stay
- A way to stay employed and valued while finding something better

**What would make him stay longer:**
- More money (would have to be $160k to demonstrate commitment)
- Even at $160k, trust issue is fairly deep - might still leave

**True goal:** Transition away from Outright to either:
1. Full-time freelance work, OR
2. A new full-time position

- Could also solve contractor communication problem (ticketing/task management)
- One tool, two problems solved
- Same timeline as CRM implementation

### CRM Evaluation

**Currently evaluating:**

**Purpose:**
- Better manage sales process
- Gain insights into what they win/lose, why, and to whom
- Pipeline management
- Tim is leading this evaluation

**Timeline:** Selection and implementation Q1 2026

### Internal System Preferences

**Resistance to traditional ticketing:**
- Internal culture: "cool, hip designers"
- Jared's concern: Too much process kills creativity and agile thinking
- Previous agency experience (Jared and Tim both worked there): Too much process created "dry" work
- Designers/PMs resist formal project management tools

**Need for balance:**
- Contractors genuinely frustrated by Slack chaos
- Need some structure without going corporate
- Outlign positioned as "agency-friendly" not "enterprise bureaucracy"
- Key allies for process argument: Grace (respected, process-oriented) and Sarah (Operations)

---

## Competitive & Market Context

### Why Clients Choose Outright

- Strong brand and design work (core strength)
- Creative reputation
- When they win integrated brand+web, it's because of design excellence
- Mid-sized nonprofits trust them for both brand and web

### Win/Loss Intelligence

- Currently don't have good data on why they win or lose
- Don't know who they're losing to
- CRM implementation will help track this
- Tim doesn't have "a lot of insight into why we lose on opps"

### Market Positioning Question

**Current perception:** "A creative agency that also does web"
**Desired perception:** "A full-service brand and digital agency"
**Gap:** Need to shift market perception

---

## Financial Context - Outright

### Current State
- Annual revenue: ~$1.2M total agency revenue
- Digital portion: Estimated ~$360k currently (based on plan projections)
- Ocean Conservancy project: $200k (large for them)
- Typical web projects: Mid-sized WordPress org sites (probably $50k-150k range)

### Contractor Model Economics
- Offshore agency works on fixed fees
- Outright never loses money on dev portion of builds
- Financially sustainable model
- Capacity is NOT the constraint

### Budget for Growth Initiatives
- Outright will pay for conferences/events
- Tools/software budget available (CRM, Outlign)
- Question of budget for Tim going back full-time depends on revenue growth

## Additional Context & Observations

### Why This Situation Exists

**The reduction:**
- Happened 4 months ago (around June 2025)
- Tim cut from full-time to half-time
- Two junior developers let go at same time
- Junior devs' skills weren't appropriate for the work
- Financial decision by agency

**The mismatch:**
- Junior devs focused on Next.js/headless WordPress
- Outright's clients need manageable WordPress sites
- Tim couldn't mentor in tech stack he didn't know well
- Wrong solution for small-to-medium nonprofit organizational sites

### What's Working

**Delivery:**
- Contractor model working financially
- Plenty of capacity
- Fixed-fee arrangements protect margins
- Projects getting delivered

**Sales:**
- Winning some integrated brand+web projects
- Ocean Conservancy success story
- Tim valuable in sales pursuits
- Good client relationships

**Relationships:**
- Grace and Sarah as potential allies
- Client satisfaction seems good
- Ongoing work continues smoothly

### What's Not Working

**For Tim personally:**
- Compensation cut in half
- No raise in 1.5 years
- Doesn't feel at home
- Doesn't trust leadership
- Timeline pressure (needs full-time income in 2 months)
- Job security concerns

**For Outright's operations:**
- Contractor frustration with ad-hoc processes
- Lack of pipeline intelligence (no CRM)
- No win/loss tracking
- Deal flow constraint (not capacity)
- Market positioning unclear (design agency vs. full-service)

**For growth:**
- No clear business development strategy
- Limited market presence in nonprofit sector
- No systematic approach to conferences/networking
- Process resistance limiting contractor effectiveness

## Strategy Insights from Conversation

### The Two-Plan Approach

**Plan A - Outright Proposal:**
- 90-day quick wins (buy time through early 2026)
- 12-month vision (shows strategic thinking whether Tim executes or not)
- Demonstrates value: revenue generation, operational excellence, capability expansion
- Keeps Tim employed during job search

**Plan B - Personal Career Plan:**
- Secure full-time income by end of December 2025
- Pursue Maryland and Teal Media opportunities
- Build freelance practice as backup
- Exit Outright when better option materializes

### Why This Approach Makes Sense

**For Tim:**
- Maintains income while job searching
- Demonstrates professionalism
- Creates optionality (job, freelance, or negotiate from strength)
- Reduces desperation timeline
- Documents value (good for resume/interviews)

**For Outright:**
- Gets a real strategic plan (useful even if Tim leaves)
- Clear path to growth if they choose to invest
- Solves real problems (contractor frustration, pipeline intelligence)
- Positions digital practice for next leader if Tim exits

### The Balanced Process Argument

**Why it matters:**
- Contractors genuinely frustrated (real business problem)
- Outlign already being evaluated (opportunity to join, not force)
- Grace and Sarah as allies (not Tim alone pushing)
- Can frame as protecting creativity, not constraining it

**The pitch:**
1. Creative people hate repetitive questions → process eliminates interruptions
2. Ambiguity creates bad creative work → clear requirements = better first drafts
3. Budget transparency enables risk-taking → knowing what's spent allows bold ideas
4. Right tool disappears → agency-specific, not enterprise bureaucracy

**Why this might work:**
- Acknowledges Jared's legitimate concern
- Positioned as solving pain (contractor frustration)
- Sarah already leading evaluation (not Tim's project)
- One tool for multiple needs (resource planning + project management)
