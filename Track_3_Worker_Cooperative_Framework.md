# Track 3: Worker Cooperative Framework
## Nonprofit Web Development Collective

**Created:** November 18, 2025
**Status:** Planning Phase
**Timeline:** 12-36 months to viability

---

## Vision

Build a democratic, worker-owned cooperative providing web development services (WordPress/Drupal) to nonprofit organizations. Create meaningful work, fair compensation, and collective ownership while serving mission-driven clients who share cooperative values.

---

## Why This Makes Sense

### Strategic Advantages

1. **Leverages collective nonprofit network** - Built-in client relationships from 20+ years combined experience
2. **Values alignment** - Nonprofits appreciate cooperative structure
3. **Specific people identified** - PM, Drupal/WordPress dev, designers ready
4. **Proven market** - Multiple successful tech co-ops exist (Palante, CoLab, Agaric)
5. **Part-time viable** - Can start while maintaining Outright income
6. **Lower financial risk** - Service business requires minimal startup capital
7. **Democratic control** - No more "don't trust them to do right by me"

### Financial Reality Check

**Startup capital needed:** $10k-$25k total (low-end scenario)
- Legal fees: $2k-$5k
- Member buy-ins: $500-$1,000 each (4-5 people = $2k-$5k)
- Marketing/branding: $1k-$3k
- Operating reserve: $5k-$12k

**Timeline to sustainable income:**
- Part-time approach: 24-36 months to full-time for all members
- 12-18 months to proof of concept (covering basic costs)
- 6-12 months to first paid project

**This fits your December 2025 deadline:** NO - but works as parallel long-term track

---

## Core Team

### Identified People

1. **Tim Arnold** - Frontend dev, WordPress, client relations, sales/scoping, 20yr nonprofit network
2. **JoMarie Hoholik** - Project Manager, 17+ years experience (since 2008), manages projects, client communication, timelines
3. **Krystee Dryer** - Drupal/WordPress Developer, 8+ years web development for nonprofits (since 2017), backend development, complements Tim's frontend strength
4. **Designer(s)** - (Names TBD) - Visual design, UX, brand work

### Required Commitment

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Exploration**
- 8-12 hours/month per person
- Weekly 2-hour meetings
- Study co-op model together
- Market research

**Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Formation**
- 12-16 hours/month per person
- Legal incorporation
- Brand/website development
- First small projects

**Phase 3 (Months 13-24): Proof of Concept**
- 15-25 hours/month per person (still part-time)
- Active client work
- Revenue generation begins
- Refine processes

**Phase 4 (Months 25-36): Transition to Full-Time**
- First member(s) go full-time when revenue supports
- Others follow as growth continues

## Legal Structure (Recommended)

### Option 1: Virginia Cooperative Corporation (Preferred)

**Why Virginia:**
- Best worker cooperative legislation in your area (enacted 2020)
- Protects cooperative terminology and principles
- Internal capital accounting provisions
- Close to DC/Maryland location

**Tax benefits:**
- Subchapter T federal tax treatment
- Patronage dividends deductible by co-op
- Members get 20% pass-through business deduction
- Single taxation (not double-taxed)

**Structure:**
- Articles of incorporation (file with Virginia)
- Cooperative bylaws (democratic governance)
- Member agreements (rights/responsibilities)
- One worker, one vote (fundamental principle)

### Option 2: LLC with Cooperative Operating Agreement

**If Virginia co-op corp proves too complex:**
- File LLC in DC, Maryland, or Virginia
- Operating Agreement establishes cooperative practices
- More flexible, simpler filing
- May not qualify for Subchapter T tax benefits

**Recommendation:** Start with Virginia co-op corp (future-proof for growth)

---

## Governance Model

### Decision-Making (Recommended Hybrid)

**For 4-5 person team, use:**

1. **Strategic decisions:** Modified consensus (consensus minus one)
   - Adding new members
   - Major financial commitments
   - Service offerings
   - Pricing structure changes

2. **Operational decisions:** Consent-based (sociocracy)
   - Project acceptance
   - Resource allocation
   - Process changes

3. **Routine decisions:** Delegated authority
   - Project management details
   - Client communications
   - Technical implementation choices

**As you grow (8+ members):** Evolve to full sociocracy or holacracy

### Board Structure

**Initially (4-5 members):**
- All members serve on board
- Board = full membership
- Quarterly formal board meetings
- Weekly operational meetings

**Later (if growing beyond 7 members):**
- Elected board of 3-5 members
- Annual elections
- Majority worker-owners required

---

## Financial Model

### Member Buy-In (Recommended Hybrid)

**Initial investment per member:**
- Cash: $500-$1,000 upfront
- Sweat equity: Work during startup at reduced/no pay
- Total target buy-in: $3,000-$5,000 per member over 2-3 years
- Method: Initial payment + payroll deductions once revenue exists

### Internal Capital Accounts (ICAs)

Each member has individual equity account tracking:
- Initial buy-in payments
- Sweat equity contributions
- Patronage dividend allocations
- Redemptions upon departure

### Profit Distribution

**Annual surplus allocation:**
1. **Indivisible reserves: 20%** (permanent co-op capital, prevents sellout)
2. **Individual patronage dividends: 80%** distributed based on hours worked
   - Minimum 20% paid in cash (for taxes)
   - Remaining 60% credited to member ICAs or paid out

**Formula:**
```
Your dividend = (Your hours / Total member hours) × 80% of surplus
```

**Example:**
- Co-op earns $50k surplus after expenses
- $10k to indivisible reserves (20%)
- $40k to members (80%)
- If you worked 500 hours out of 2,000 total member hours:
  - Your share = (500/2000) × $40k = $10k
  - $2k paid in cash (for taxes)
  - $8k credited to your ICA (or paid if co-op chooses)

### Salary Structure (Startup Phase)

**Recommended: Equal pay for all**
- Example: Palante Tech pays all workers $40/hour
- Simplest and most egalitarian
- Clear cooperative values
- Easy administration

**Alternative: Limited pay bands (2-3 levels)**
- Junior: $35-40/hour
- Mid: $45-50/hour
- Senior: $55-60/hour
- Maximum 2:1 ratio (prevents inequality)

**Reality during startup:**
- Members likely work below market rate initially
- May need to maintain outside employment for 12-24 months
- Gradual transition to full market rates as revenue grows

### Reserve Requirements

**Operating reserve target:**
- 3-6 months operating expenses minimum
- Build from 20% indivisible reserves allocation
- Provides stability during slow periods
- Service businesses can operate with less than product businesses

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Core team members don't commit or drop out

**Mitigation:**
- **Phase 1 is low-commitment test** (3 months, minimal financial investment)
- Long trial period before major financial commitments
- Clear expectations upfront about time/money required
- Regular check-ins on commitment level
- OK to decide it's not right - better to know early

**Contingency:**
- Need minimum 3 people to proceed
- Can recruit replacement members during Phase 1-2
- If falls apart, minimal loss ($500-$1,000 each + time)

### Risk 2: Market validation fails (nonprofits not interested)

**Mitigation:**
- **Interview 15-20 nonprofits in Phase 1** before incorporating
- Test pricing and service concepts
- Leverage collective network for honest feedback
- Research competitors to understand market

**Contingency:**
- Pivot service offerings based on feedback
- Adjust target market (e.g., unions, social enterprises)
- Decide not to proceed if market isn't there
- Low cost to learn this (just time)

### Risk 3: Can't generate revenue fast enough

**Mitigation:**
- **Part-time approach reduces pressure**
- Members maintain other income sources during startup
- Conservative financial planning (don't quit jobs prematurely)
- Start with warm leads from collective network (faster sales)
- Retainer model provides predictable income

**Contingency:**
- Extend timeline (not a failure, just slower growth)
- Take on more contract/freelance work individually
- Scale back ambitions but keep co-op alive
- Some members stay part-time longer while others go full-time

### Risk 4: Team conflict or governance challenges

**Mitigation:**
- **Study co-op model together** (shared language and expectations)
- Use proven decision-making frameworks (consensus, sociocracy)
- External facilitation for difficult conversations
- Clear conflict resolution process in bylaws
- 9-12 month provisional period for new members (both sides evaluate fit)

**Contingency:**
- Mediation through USFWC or other co-op support org
- Member departure provisions in bylaws (buyout of capital account)
- In worst case, dissolve and divide assets per bylaws
- Indivisible reserves go to co-op development fund (not lost)

### Risk 5: Can't compete with larger agencies or offshore developers

**Mitigation:**
- **Don't compete on price** - compete on values and quality
- Target nonprofits who care about mission alignment
- Emphasize cooperative structure (shared values)
- Focus on sustainable, maintainable solutions
- Build strong relationships (not transactional)
- Specialization in nonprofit sector (deep expertise)

**Contingency:**
- Niche down further (specific nonprofit subsectors)
- Develop proprietary tools or processes
- Collaborate with other co-ops for larger projects
- Focus on retainer/ongoing relationships vs. one-off projects

### Risk 6: Long timeline to sustainable income

**Reality:**
- 6-12 months minimum to first paid project
- 24-36 months to full-time sustainable income
- Requires patience and financial runway

**Mitigation:**
- **Part-time startup approach**
- Members maintain other employment during startup
- Minimal time commitment initially (8-12 hours/month)
- Can explore while maintaining other income sources
- Low financial investment in early phases

**Strategic approach:**
- Start with minimal commitment to test viability
- Scale up involvement as revenue grows
- Some members may transition to full-time before others
- Flexible timeline based on actual revenue growth

## Why This Could Be the Best Option Long-Term

### Compared to Traditional Employment

**Advantages:**
- **Democratic control** - You have a vote in all major decisions
- **No more "don't trust them"** - You ARE the ownership
- **Fair compensation** - Surplus goes to workers, not distant owners
- **Values alignment** - Serve nonprofits with shared cooperative values
- **Sustainability** - Multi-generational co-ops exist (Mondragon, Agaric)
- **Meaningful work** - Building something bigger than yourself

**Trade-offs:**
- **Higher risk** - No guaranteed salary initially
- **More responsibility** - Democratic governance takes time and energy
- **Slower income growth** - 2-3 year timeline vs. immediate job
- **More complexity** - Running a business vs. being employee

### Compared to Traditional Freelancing

**Advantages:**
- **Not alone** - Shared risk, shared workload, shared decision-making
- **Larger projects** - Can take on bigger work with team
- **Mutual support** - Coverage when sick, on vacation, or slow
- **Benefits** - Health insurance, PTO possible when pooling resources
- **Democratic** - Equal say vs. one founder calling shots
- **Legacy** - Building something that outlasts you

**Trade-offs:**
- **Shared profits** - Can't keep everything you generate
- **Consensus needed** - Can't just make unilateral decisions
- **Commitment required** - Harder to exit than solo freelancing
- **Governance time** - Meetings and democratic process take time

### The Unique Value Proposition

**This is the ONLY track that gives you:**
- Democratic workplace (you have a voice)
- Fair treatment (you set the rules together)
- Serving mission-driven organizations (values alignment)
- Building equity (you own it)
- Creating sustainable employment for others (not just yourself)
- Contributing to cooperative movement (bigger purpose)

**For someone who:**
- Has 20 years nonprofit network (your advantage)
- Never felt "at home" at Outright (cultural fit matters)
- Doesn't trust conventional employers (repeated experience)
- Values mission-driven work (lifetime of nonprofit consulting)
- Wants more control but not total isolation (democratic middle ground)

**This might be the best long-term fit.**

## Final Thoughts

This is a **long-term play**, not a quick fix for December 2025.

But it's **absolutely viable**:
- ✓ Proven model (Palante, CoLab, Agaric show it works)
- ✓ Your skills fit (WordPress/Drupal, nonprofit sector, client relations)
- ✓ Market exists (nonprofits need websites, value cooperative structure)
- ✓ Team identified (PM, dev, designers)
- ✓ Low startup cost ($10k-$25k total)
- ✓ Part-time compatible (can start while doing other work)
- ✓ Strong support resources (USFWC, DAWI, SELC, Tech Co-op Network)

**The risk is LOW** if approached methodically:
- Phase 1 costs only time + maybe $500
- Can decide not to proceed after 3 months
- Even if it fails, you'll have learned a lot and built relationships
- Compatible with maintaining other income sources

**The potential upside is HIGH**:
- Democratic ownership and control
- Fair compensation and meaningful work
- Serving organizations that share your values
- Building something lasting and potentially multi-generational
- No more "I don't trust them to do right by me"

**Recommended: Start Phase 1** to explore this opportunity. Worst case, you learn it's not right. Best case, you build the workplace you've always wanted.
